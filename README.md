# react-rematch

React bindings for Rematch's flavor of Redux

## Documentation

- [API docs](/docs/API.md)

## Future

- [These helpers line up great with the Hook proposal!](/docs/hooks.md)

## Motivation

Rematch removes the boilerplate from redux. There's still a lot of boilerplate in React since the Redux bindings don't know about it's conventions.

In addition, by removing things like subscriptions, Rematch forces side-effects to exist _correctly_ as a component in your architecture - leading to a react specific implementation.
